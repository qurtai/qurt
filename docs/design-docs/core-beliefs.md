3. **Practical intelligence over hype**
   - features must improve real task outcomes, not just look advanced
4. **Local-first trust**
   - local desktop workflows should be robust and transparent

## Engineering Beliefs

1. **Reliability and security are core features**
2. **Small, reversible iterations beat risky rewrites**
3. **Architecture and docs must evolve with code**
4. **Explicit boundaries (IPC, service adapters, storage contracts) reduce risk**
5. **Measure behavior before optimizing**
