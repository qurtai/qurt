Nixpacks Reference (for LLMs)
=============================

Status:
- Nixpacks is not currently the primary documented build/runtime path for this repository.

Current build path:
- Desktop app build uses: npm run build
- Toolchain: TypeScript + Vite + Electron Builder

Guidance for agents:
- Do not assume Nixpacks config exists unless added later.
- If Nixpacks support is requested, document it explicitly in new deployment docs and keep this file updated.
