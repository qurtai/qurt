Design System Reference (for LLMs)
==================================

Project: alem
Stack: React + Tailwind utility classes + shared component patterns

Design language:
- Desktop-first interface
- Clean, high-contrast dark/light theme support
- Rounded surfaces, subtle borders, compact spacing

Conventions:
- Reuse existing components from src/components before introducing new ones
- Keep page composition in src/pages; reusable pieces in src/components
- Prefer existing utility class patterns (e.g. rounded-xl, border-n-*, text-n-*)
- Use existing text styles (h3/h4/h5/base2/caption1/caption2) where applicable

Interaction patterns:
- Show loading/error state near the triggering control
- Keep "primary action" visually clear
- Preserve keyboard accessibility for interactive elements
- Keep attachment interactions obvious and reversible

Do:
- Match current class naming and spacing rhythm
- Preserve existing visual hierarchy in Home and Chat pages
- Keep controls readable in both themes

Do not:
- Introduce a new visual style system for one feature
- Break established spacing/typography tokens without design intent
- Hide critical errors from the user
