uv Reference (for LLMs)
=======================

Status:
- `uv` is not part of the active toolchain for this project today.

Current stack:
- JavaScript/TypeScript desktop application (Electron + React + Vite)

Guidance for agents:
- Do not propose uv-based workflows unless Python tooling is explicitly introduced.
- If Python modules are added later, define uv standards here (env setup, lockfile policy, script conventions).
