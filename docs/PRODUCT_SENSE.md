# PRODUCT SENSE

Product thinking guide for `alem`.

## Naming And Meaning

`alem` means "world" in Kazakh. The product ambition matches the name: give users access to the broadest practical world of AI models and agents without provider lock-in.

## Core Problem

Most users are pushed toward one vendor ecosystem. They lose flexibility, bargaining power, and the ability to choose the best model for each task.

## Product Promise

- bring your own API keys
- choose providers/models fairly
- keep user control over data and configuration
- support serious workflows (files, images, and eventually tool-using agents)

## Current Value Delivered

- desktop chat experience
- file/image attachments and discussion in chat context
- provider key configuration
- model enablement and active model switching

## Target Users

- AI power users who want cross-provider flexibility
- learners exploring model strengths and trade-offs
- builders doing practical multi-step work on local machines

## Product Questions For Every Feature

- Does this increase user freedom or create hidden lock-in?
- Does this reduce cognitive load for model/provider choice?
- Does this preserve transparency and trust?
- Can this ship as a small, testable increment?
- How does this improve task completion quality and speed?
