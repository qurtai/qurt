# Mobile App

## Problem

Users want `alem` workflows beyond desktop, especially for quick follow-ups, review, and lightweight task handling.

## Goal

Ship a mobile experience that extends core `alem` value while preserving user freedom in provider/model choice.

## Scope (Early)

- chat access and history continuity
- attachment support where practical
- provider/model visibility and lightweight settings

## Non-Goals (Early)

- full parity with desktop agent tooling
- heavy local automation tasks
- every advanced desktop template/page

## Product Requirements

- clear "desktop vs mobile" capability boundaries
- responsive, low-friction chat UX
- secure key handling model appropriate for mobile
- sync dependency on storage-provider abstraction

## Success Metrics

- weekly active mobile users
- cross-device session continuity rate
- mobile retention and response-time satisfaction
